# Comparative-study-of-low-resolution-images-to-high-resolution-images
Improving the quality of an image is an important task in many fields, including computer graphics, photography, and video processing. In this project, we aim to improve the quality and resolution of images using various upscaling algorithms and techniques. We first review the existing literature on image upscaling and compare the performance of different methods using different metrics.

To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, we will use a diverse set of images, including natural scenes, text, and low-light images. We will also analyze the robustness of the algorithms by testing them on images with different levels of noise, distortion, or compression.

This project explores various approaches for image upscaling and classification. We trained a Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) model and compared its performance to other algorithms such as BICUBIC, LAPSRN, and EDSR. We also evaluated the effectiveness of different CNN algorithms for image classification tasks. The findings suggest that the SRGAN model is superior to other tested algorithms for image upscaling and CNN models are highly effective in image classification tasks. This project provides insights into the strengths and limitations of different image processing techniques and could inspire further research in this area.
